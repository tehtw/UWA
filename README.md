A selection of projects from my studies at UWA

* <h2>Project 1</h2> - Azure based Red/Blue Team Cybersecurity Lab c/w DVWA's and ELK Stack for IDS. The main purpose of the project was to create cloud network with security controls and a load balanced and monitored instances of Damn Vulnerable Web Applications.

* <h2>8: Networking Fundamentals Homework</h2> - Though we weren't expected to produce a report, this was the first scenario project and I ran with it. I tried to create what I would expect to recieve if I was a/the company requesting a Pentest.

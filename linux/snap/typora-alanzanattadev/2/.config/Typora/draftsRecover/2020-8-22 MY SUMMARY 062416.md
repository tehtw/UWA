UWAB00TR00T was approached Lucky Duck to conduct a investigation into some recent suspicious activity at one of their establishments.  Using data provided by Lucky Duck, we conducted a detailed search and compared a range of loss dates and cross referenced dealer and player names to establish patterns. 

Between the 10th and the 13th of Match there was a total of 13 losses with a total loss of over 1.2 million.  After scanning the data we have also found that there was a dealer and player that was present when every loss, Mylie Schmdit and Billy Jones. 

We devised some scripts that can be used by in house security staff that enable you to search any future data files based on time date and game.
